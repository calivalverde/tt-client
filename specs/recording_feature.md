# üéôÔ∏è New Feature Specification ‚Äî User Recording Functionality

## üß© Feature Details

### **1. Recording Functionality**

- **Purpose:**  
  Let the user record short audio clips for practice or self-assessment.

- **Behavior:**
  - User can start and stop a recording using a **‚ÄúRecord‚Äù** button.
  - Maximum duration: **30 seconds** per recording.
  - Recording automatically stops when the 30-second limit is reached.
  - After recording, the user can:
    - Play back the recorded clip.
    - Delete or re-record if desired.
  - Recordings are **not uploaded** automatically ‚Äî only stored locally (in memory or temporary blob).

### **2. Microphone Permission**

- **Behavior:**
  - When the user clicks ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù for the first time, the app must request **microphone access** using the browser‚Äôs **native permission dialog**.
  - Use the standard **MediaRecorder API** and **navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })**.
  - If permission is denied, show a clear message:
    > ‚ÄúMicrophone access is required to record audio. Please allow access in your browser settings.‚Äù

### **3. User Interface**

  - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Play** ‚Äî plays back the last recording.
  - üóëÔ∏è **Delete** ‚Äî clears the current recording.

- **Layout:**
  - Match the current site theme:
    - Background: `bg-gray-900`
    - Text: `text-green-400`
    - Font: `font-mono`

### **4. Implementation Notes**

- **APIs Used:**
  - `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })`
  - `MediaRecorder` for capturing audio
  - `URL.createObjectURL()` for local playback preview

- **Duration Enforcement:**
  - Use a `setTimeout` or `MediaRecorder.stop()` after 30 seconds.
  - Visually indicate when recording time is almost up (e.g., red text or blinking).

- **Cleanup:**
  - Stop and release the microphone stream on component unmount or stop event.
